 <p><font color="LightCoral">My name is Dana. I am from Palestine and have been born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I graduated from an international school last year, and I am studying at Alyamamah University. My major focus is on software engineering. I look forward to pursuing a double major, so I will be a software and network security engineer. My number one goal is to have my own company. Hopefully, I will achieve this dream one day.I do not really have that many hobbies. I like playing piano, and I really enjoy cooking time.
